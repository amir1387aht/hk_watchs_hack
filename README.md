## üß© Overview
This repository contains:
- SiFli SDK project files for HK watch firmware  
  *(example path: `projects/hk10ultra3_firmware/v1/watch/project`)*
- Build scripts and a UART flashing helper used in the demo video  
- Documentation for reproducing the reverse-engineering workflow

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- Windows PC (SDK tools are Windows-oriented)  
- Installed **SiFli SDK**  
- **Python** and **scons** (usually included with SDK)  
- **UART-to-USB** adapter (e.g., CH340, FTDI)  
- Basic familiarity with serial ports / command line

---

## üì¶ Install SDK
Follow the official SiFli SDK installation guide:

üëâ [https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb52x/quickstart/install/script/windows.html](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb52x/quickstart/install/script/windows.html)

> After installing, always use the **‚ÄúSiFli-SDK Environment‚Äù** terminal ‚Äî it configures all paths and tools for you.

---

## üß∞ Build / Compile
1. Open the **SiFli-SDK Environment** shell.  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd projects\hk10ultra3_firmware\v1\watch\project
````

3. Compile:

   ```bash
   scons --board=eh-lb525 -j8
   ```

   * `--board=eh-lb525` sets the build target.
   * `-j8` runs 8 jobs in parallel (adjust based on CPU cores).

üìÅ Build outputs appear under `build_eh-lb525_hcpu`.

---

## üß≠ Menu Configuration

To open configuration UI:

```bash
scons --menuconfig --board=eh-lb525
```

Use **arrow keys** and **Enter** to modify settings.
Save and exit to apply your configuration.

---

## üîå Flashing (UART)

1. Connect the watch to your UART-USB adapter *(see video for pinout)*.
2. Run this command from the SDK shell:

   ```bash
   build_eh-lb525_hcpu\uart_download.bat
   ```
3. When prompted, choose your **COM port** (e.g., `COM3`, `COM6`).

> üí° If flashing fails, check wiring (TX‚ÜîRX), COM port, or boot mode.

## ü™õ Wiring / Hardware Notes

Typical UART wiring:

| Watch Pin | USB Adapter | Description      |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| TX        | RX          | Data transmit    |
| RX        | TX          | Data receive     |
| GND       | GND         | Ground reference |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT power the watch from the adapter** unless the guide/video says so ‚Äî incorrect voltage can destroy the device.
If your adapter is 3.3 V or 5 V and the watch uses 1.8 V logic, use a **level shifter**.

Some models require entering bootloader mode manually (button press or pin short).
Refer to the demo video for your specific model.

---

## üßØ Troubleshooting

**Build errors**

* Make sure you‚Äôre using *SiFli-SDK Environment*.
* Check that `scons` and the toolchain are accessible.
* Review the console for missing files or dependency errors.

**Flashing issues**

* Verify correct COM port and close other serial tools.
* Swap TX/RX if flashing fails.
* Confirm solid GND and stable power.
* Some devices must be manually put into bootloader mode.

**Device not responding**

* Ensure proper power and wiring.
* Retry after entering bootloader mode.
* Avoid using adapters that output 5 V to 1.8 V lines.

## üßæ Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build project
scons --board=eh-lb525 -j8

# Open menuconfig
scons --menuconfig --board=eh-lb525

# Flash via UART
build_eh-lb525_hcpu\uart_download.bat
```
