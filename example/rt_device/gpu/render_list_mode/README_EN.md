```
## Introduction
    This example program uses drv_epic's render list mode to create some rendering operations including fill, draw, rectangle, polygon, border, arc, line, bitmap font and other operations, and uses 2 framebuffers of 1/16 screen size (`render_buffer`) to render and send the results to the screen for display.
	After one rendering operation is completed, it will continue to repeat the previous rendering operations and send the display results to the screen.
## Project Description
	- This example can work on 52x, 56x with PSRAM packaging tests.
