# BLE peripheral Example

Source code path: example/ble/peripheral

(Platform_peri)=
## Supported Platforms
<!-- Which boards and chip platforms are supported -->
All platforms

## Overview
<!-- Example introduction -->
This example demonstrates how to implement GAP peripheral and GATT server functionality on this platform.


## Usage Instructions
<!-- Explain how to use the example, such as which hardware pins to connect to observe waveforms, compilation and flashing can reference related documentation.
For rt_device examples, also list the configuration switches used in this example, for example PWM example uses PWM1, need to enable PWM1 in onchip menu -->
1. When operating as a slave device, the board starts advertising upon boot with the name SIFLI_APP-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx, where xx represents the Bluetooth address of the device. It can be connected via BLE apps on mobile phones.
2. When operating as a GATT server, write and read operations can be performed from the mobile client, or by enabling CCCD, the device will update the characteristic value every second.


### Hardware Requirements
Before running this example, prepare:
+ One development board supported by this example ([Supported Platforms](#Platform_peri)).
+ Mobile device.

### menuconfig Configuration
1. Enable Bluetooth (`BLUETOOTH`):
    - Path: Sifli middleware → Bluetooth
    - Enable: Enable bluetooth
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BLUETOOTH`
        - Description: Enable Bluetooth functionality
2. Enable GAP, GATT Client, BLE connection manager:
    - Path: Sifli middleware → Bluetooth → Bluetooth service → BLE service
    - Enable: Enable BLE GAP central role
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BLE_GAP_CENTRAL`
        - Description: Switch for BLE CENTRAL (central device). When enabled, it provides scanning and active connection initiation with peripherals.
    - Enable: Enable BLE GATT client
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BLE_GATT_CLIENT`
        - Description: Switch for GATT CLIENT. When enabled, it can actively search and discover services, read/write data, and receive notifications.
    - Enable: Enable BLE connection manager
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BSP_BLE_CONNECTION_MANAGER`
        - Description: Provides BLE connection control management, including multi-connection management, BLE pairing, link connection parameter updates, etc.
3. Enable NVDS:
    - Path: Sifli middleware → Bluetooth → Bluetooth service → Common service
    - Enable: Enable NVDS synchronous
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BSP_BLE_NVDS_SYNC`
        - Description: Bluetooth NVDS synchronization. When Bluetooth is configured to HCPU, BLE NVDS can be accessed synchronously, so enable this option; when Bluetooth is configured to LCPU, this option needs to be disabled.

### Compilation and Flashing
Switch to the example project directory and run the scons command to compile:
```c
> scons --board=eh-lb525 -j32
```
Switch to the example `project/build_xx` directory and run `uart_download.bat`, then select the port as prompted to download:
```c
$ ./uart_download.bat

     Uart Download

please input the serial port num:5
```
For detailed compilation and download steps, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart/get-started.md).

## Expected Results
<!-- Describe the expected results of running the example, such as which LEDs will light up, what logs will be printed, to help users determine if the example is running normally. Results can be explained step by step in conjunction with the code -->
After the example starts:
1. It can be discovered and connected by mobile BLE apps, allowing corresponding GATT characteristic value read/write operations.


## Troubleshooting


## Reference Documentation
<!-- For rt_device examples, RT-Thread official documentation provides detailed explanations. Web links can be added here, for example, refer to RT-Thread's [RTC Documentation](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/rt-thread-version/rt-thread-standard/programming-manual/device/rtc/rtc) -->
